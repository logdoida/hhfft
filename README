0.0 Introduction

HHFFT is C++ library for performing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for vectors and matrices. HHFFT includes also a Python 3 wrapper.

2.0 Description

HHFFT is able to perform FFT an IFFT for real or complex inputs. Both vectors (1D) and matrices (2D) are supported. The size of the input can be arbitrary, as long a all dimension are smaller than 2^32. Sizes composed of small prime factors, such as 2,3 or 5, are typically transformed faster than those composed of large prime factors.

HHFFT has been developed using gcc compiler on Linux for x86-64 architectures. It is written in C++11 and is optimized for sse2 and avx instruction sets. The correct instruction set is detected run-time, so it is possible to compile and use it on different hardware.


3.0 Installation and Testing

To compile the library start terminal go to the directory where HHFFT is uncompressed and type
   mkdir bin
   cd bin
   cmake ..
   make

To specify where the library should be installed use
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/where/to/install/hhfft .. 
instead of just plain "cmake .."

If you want to install the compiled library run
   sudo make install

To test that the compilation has been successful, run the test1
   ./hhfft_test1

After running the test, the last line of the output should read "Test passed!"


4.0 Linking the Library with Your Project

To link with HHFFT use -lhhfft flag when calling the compiler.
If the library is not found when running the program try to call:
   sudo ldconfig


5.0 Python Wrapper

HHFFT has a Python 3 wrapper. It uses numpy arrays as input and output. See python/hhfft.py for examples on how to use it.

To use the Python wrapper, HHFFT C++ library must first be compiled and installed as instructed in Section 3.0. Then to compile and install the hhfft Python package, call
   cd python
   sudo python3 setup.py install

In order to test the HHFFT on Python, run
   python3 hhfft_test.py
