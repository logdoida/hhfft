2.0 Description
HHFFT is able to perform FFT an IFFT for real and complex inputs. Both vectors (1D) and matrices (2D) are supported. The dimensions must be composed of prime factors 2,3,5 or 7.

HHFFT has been optimized for sse2 and avx instruction sets. The correct instruction set is detected run-time.


3.0 Installation and testing

To compile the library start terminal go to the directory where HHFFT is uncompressed and type:

mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ..
make

To specify where the library should be installed use
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/where/to/put/hhfft .. 
instead of just cmake ..

If you want to install the compiled library run
sudo make install

To test that the compilation has been successful, run the test1
./hhfft_test1

on the last line of the output should read "Test passed!"


4.0 Linking library to your project

To link with HHFFT use -lhhfft flag in compiler.
If the library is not found when running the program try to call:
sudo ldconfig
